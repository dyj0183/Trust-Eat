# BYU-I Trust Eat - React App
[Official Website](https://byui-trust-eat.netlify.app/)

# Overview

This is an application designed for 15,000+ BYU-Idaho students to use. They can use it to search for restaurants in the Rexburg and Idaho Falls areas. They can also write reviews for these restaurants, and if they want, they can also add a new restaurant into the Home page for others to review. We hope this app will help more BYU-Idaho students know where to go when they want to find a good restaurant.
